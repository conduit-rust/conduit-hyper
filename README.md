# conduit-hyper

This crate integrates a `hyper 0.14` server with a `conduit 0.10` application
stack.

## Usage

This crate is in maintenance mode, intended only for use within the crates.io
codebase. If you wish to use this crate please reach out to us in the
[issue-tracker](https://github.com/conduit-rust/conduit-hyper/issues).

While some protection against large requests is provided, this server should
not be exposed directly to the public internet. It is highly recommended that
the server be used behind a production-grade reverse-proxy for such
applications. 

Potential security vulnerabilities should be reported per our [security policy].

## Error and Panic Handling

If the application handler returns an `Err(_)` the server will log the
description via the `tracing` crate and then return a generic 500 status response.

If the handler panics, the default panic handler prints a message to stderr and the
connnection is closed without sending a response.  In the future, these panics
will likely be turned into a generic 500 status response.

## Request Processing

If the request includes a body, the entire body is buffered before the handler
is dispatched on a thread.  There is currently no restriction on the maximum
body size so a client can consume large amounts of memory by sending a large
body.  Therefore it is recommended to use a reverse proxy which limits the
maximum body size.

Header values that are not valid UTF-8 are replaced with an empty string.

### conduit::Request

The following methods on the `Request` provided to the application have
noteworthy behavior:

* `scheme` always returns Http as https is not currently directly supported
* `host` returns an empty string if the `Host` header is not valid UTF-8

All other methods on `Request` should behave as expected.

## TODO

* Include the `X-Request-Id` header when logging an error
